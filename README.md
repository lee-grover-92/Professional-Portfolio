# 🐾 Pet Insurance Analytics Project  
*A full end‑to‑end SQL + Python + BI project simulating a real‑world pet insurance business.*

This project models the operations of a UK‑based pet insurance provider using a fully relational MySQL database and synthetically generated data. It mirrors the expectations of a junior data analyst role by covering the entire analytics lifecycle.

### 🔍 Highlights
- Fully normalised relational schema (customers, pets, policies, claims, vet visits, payments)  
- Python‑generated synthetic data with realistic business logic  
- Bulk loading, validation, and integrity checks in MySQL  
- Analytical SQL queries for KPIs such as loss ratio, claim frequency, CLV, and breed risk  
- Processed datasets for BI tools  
- Power BI/Tableau dashboards

# 🏎️ F1 Podium Probability Analysis (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)  
*A predictive modelling project estimating the probability of a Formula 1 driver achieving a podium finish.*

This project uses historical F1 data (1950–2020) to build an interpretable classification model and uncover the factors that most influence podium outcomes.

### 🔍 Highlights
- Multi‑dataset ingestion and cleaning (drivers, constructors, circuits, races, results)  
- Feature engineering (driver experience, constructor form, qualifying deltas, circuit characteristics)  
- Exploratory analysis of driver, team, and circuit trends  
- Predictive modelling using logistic regression / decision trees  
- Feature importance analysis for stakeholder insights  
- Interactive dashboard for exploring podium probabilities
